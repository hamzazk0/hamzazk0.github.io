# Summary
The opportunity to setting up a new Windows machine doesn't come up often. Because of this, how I prefer to setup has never been documented. The following is a list of steps to go from Old machine to ready to use fresh install of Windows.

This Process was generated by backing up and resetting my personal laptop

# Steps
1. Backup (if old machine)
2. Reset the PC
3. When setting up, disconnect from internet
4. Run ninite
    * Do not install python with ninite as it won't include pip or the PATH addition
5. Disable One-drive
    * Will include * */OneDrive/* * in all User paths otherwise
6. Setup installed apps
7. Setup Firefox to sync with other machines
8. Setup Google Drive

# Optional Inclusions
* [Development Environment Setup by Technotim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL8iGErULiw)
* Add any other useful references
