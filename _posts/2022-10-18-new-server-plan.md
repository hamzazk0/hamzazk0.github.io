# Summary
I recently ordered a Dell T620 12 Bay Tower Server off of Ebay. This comes after a long time of wanting one dedicated machine that can do everything. I came to the decision of going through this process when my DELL Mini PC did not have enough storage to continuously backup my Desktop. 

# Plan
The tower will be my main server that runs any Homelab services that I want. It will be virtualized using Proxmox. The 8x3.5" 2TB hard drives will be split into 2 main sections

## Section 1
The first server intance will be a TrueNAS server for backing up media and running a Plex or Jellyfin server.
Section 2

## Section 2
The second half of drives will be free space for any other processes

# Future Plans and Ideas
* Backup photos from phone automatically
* Network monitoring and logging
* Pi-hole
* Home Automation Hub
