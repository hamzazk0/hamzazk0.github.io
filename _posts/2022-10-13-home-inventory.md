## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a python tool that can manage my large, mismatched quantity of computers and other electronics. The goal was to create a robust database that can store all of the data while the program is not running and can be used outside of the program if necessary.

This task began as a tool to reteach myself python and to sharpen my programming skills that have fallen to the way side.

## Setup

The program needs Python 3 with Tkinter to run with SQLite3 for the database. The following needs to be installed:

* PIP
* SQLite3
* OpenPyxl
* Tkinter

## Run

The program is run with a batch script on windows.

## Version Control

The version control is managed through a repository on GitHub and GitHub Desktop. This is because it was primarily written on Windows before I was familiar with command line git.

## Future Plans

As of now the program is done and will be modified to fix bugs or as other new ideas come up.
