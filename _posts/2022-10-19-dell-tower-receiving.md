    * Needed extra hands to move at 85 lbs
2. Its also very dusty
3. Loaded up two bays with some 3.5" 500 GB WD drives i had lying around
4. Bay 1,2 (from top left) has the surround bezel coming off that makes it hard to pull the sled
5. Ordered some 2.5" to 3.5" Adapters and sata relocators for putting boot disks in drive sleds
